    <h3>Background.</h3>
    <p>I grew up in Washington state and moved to Bend, Oregon in 2001. I love solving problems, and I'm passionate about programming and refining my skills as a developer. I enjoy hiking, camping, gaming, and coding. I recently moved to Portland, Oregon where I'm a student at Epicodus, a coding bootcamp for web developers.</p>

    <p>Prior to taking the C# / JavaScript / React course at Epicodus, I worked as an Application Support Specialist at G5, a tech company in Bend that specializes in digital marketing. As an Application Support Specialist, I recreated, documented, and escalated technical issues impacting G5 applications. I worked alongside engineers and assisted with coding bug fixes and features for G5 applications. I also helped with executing test plans during application deployments, and assisted with deploying and monitoring G5 applications.</p>
    <h3>Education.</h3>
    <p>While working at G5, I attended classes at Central Oregon Community College and Oregon State University where I received an Associate of Computer Science degree. In my spare time, I enjoy creating web apps and coding tools to help with day-to-day activities.</p>
